# Javascript-Contact-Form-03-31-2020
Vanilla Javascript Form using Fetch and PHP to process the data the user submits in order to email a message to the website administrator. No JQuery required to use this javascript file. To see an operational version of the contact page just click on https://www.miniaturephotographer.com/contact.php 

If user disables javascript the contact form fallbacks to using PHP to send the email and still uses Google's Recapha (Javascript also uses Recaptcha).
